# Object Detection Project README

## Overview
This project is focused on creating a custom object detection model using the TensorFlow Object Detection API and performing real-time object detection from a webcam feed. It includes steps for data collection, model setup, training, and real-time detection. The project is designed to detect objects belonging to a set of predefined labels.

## Prerequisites
Before using this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Git

## Data Collection
The project includes data collection for object detection. It captures images from a webcam for a set of predefined labels. The collected images are saved in labeled directories.

## Setup
1. Define workspace and directory paths in the code to match your project structure.

## Labeling
- A label map file is generated (`label_map.pbtxt`) to define the labels and their corresponding IDs.

## Generate TFRecord
- Use the provided script to generate TensorFlow Record (TFRecord) files for training and testing datasets from the collected images.

## Clone TensorFlow Models
- Clone the TensorFlow Models repository, which contains pre-trained models and scripts for object detection.

## Configure Custom Model
1. Configure a custom object detection model by modifying a pre-existing model's pipeline configuration. This includes setting the number of classes, batch size, and fine-tune checkpoint.

## Real-Time Object Detection
- Run the provided code to set up real-time object detection from a webcam feed. Detected objects are overlaid with bounding boxes and class labels.

## Usage
Run the project script and follow the on-screen instructions. Press 'q' to exit the real-time detection.
